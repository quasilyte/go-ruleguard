## Overview

[analysis](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis)-based Go linter that runs dynamically loaded rules.

You write the rules, `ruleguard` checks whether they are satisfied.

`ruleguard` has some similarities with [GitHub CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql), but it's dedicated to Go only.

**Features:**

* Custom linting rules without re-compilation and Go plugins
* Diagnostics are written in a declarative way
* [Quickfix](_docs/dsl.md#suggestions-quickfix-support) actions support
* Powerful match filtering features, like expression [type pattern matching](_docs/dsl.md#type-pattern-matching)
* Rules can be installed as [Go modules](https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/ruleguard-modules/)
* Integrated into [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)

It can also be easily embedded into other static analyzers. [go-critic](https://github.com/go-critic/go-critic) can be used as an example.

## Quick start

It's advised that you get a binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/releases/tag/v0.3.1) {[linux/amd64](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/releases/download/v0.3.1/ruleguard-linux-amd64.zip), [linux/arm64](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/releases/download/v0.3.1/ruleguard-linux-arm64.zip), [darwin/amd64](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/releases/download/v0.3.1/ruleguard-darwin-amd64.zip), [windows/amd64](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/releases/download/v0.3.1/ruleguard-windows-amd64.zip)}.

If you want to install the ruleguard from source, it's as simple as:

```bash
# Installs a `ruleguard` binary under your `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`
$ GO111MODULE=on go get -v -u github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/cmd/ruleguard

# Get the DSL package (needed to execute the ruleguard files)
$ go get -v -u github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/dsl
```

> If inside a Go module, the `dsl` package will be installed for the current module,
> otherwise it installs the package into the $GOPATH and it will be globally available.

If `$GOPATH/bin` is under your system `$PATH`, `ruleguard` command should be available after that:

```bash
$ ruleguard -help
ruleguard: execute dynamic gogrep-based rules

Usage: ruleguard [-flag] [package]

Flags:
  -rules string
    	comma-separated list of ruleguard file paths
  -e string
    	execute a single rule from a given string
  -fix
    	apply all suggested fixes
  -c int
    	display offending line with this many lines of context (default -1)
  -json
    	emit JSON output
```

Create a test `rules.go` file:

```go
package gorules

import "github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/dsl"

func dupSubExpr(m dsl.Matcher) {
	m.Match(`$x || $x`,
		`$x && $x`,
		`$x | $x`,
		`$x & $x`).
		Where(m["x"].Pure).
		Report(`suspicious identical LHS and RHS`)
}

func boolExprSimplify(m dsl.Matcher) {
	m.Match(`!($x != $y)`).Suggest(`$x == $y`)
	m.Match(`!($x == $y)`).Suggest(`$x != $y`)
}
```

Create a test `example.go` target file:

```go
package main

func main() {
	var v1, v2 int
	println(!(v1 != v2))
	println(!(v1 == v2))
	if v1 == 0 && v1 == 0 {
		println("hello, world!")
	}
}
```

Run `ruleguard` on that target file:

```bash
$ ruleguard -rules rules.go -fix example.go
example.go:5:10: hint: suggested: v1 == v2
example.go:6:10: hint: suggested: v1 != v2
example.go:7:5: error: suspicious identical LHS and RHS
```

Since we ran `ruleguard` with `-fix` argument, both **suggested** changes are applied to `example.go`.

There is also a `-e` mode that is useful during the pattern debugging:

```bash
$ ruleguard -e 'm.Match(`!($x != $y)`)' example.go
example.go:5:10: !(v1 != v2)
```

It automatically inserts `Report("$$")` into the specified pattern.

You can use `-debug-group <name>` flag to see explanations
on why some rules rejected the match (e.g. which `Where()` condition failed).

The `-e` generated rule will have `e` name, so it can be debugged as well.

## How does it work?

First, it parses [ruleguard](_docs/dsl.md) files (e.g. `rules.go`) during the start to load the rule set.  

Loaded rules are then used to check the specified targets (Go files, packages).

The `rules.go` file is written in terms of [`dsl`](https://godoc.org/github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/dsl) API. Ruleguard files contain a set of functions that serve as a rule groups. Every such function accepts a single [`dsl.Matcher`](https://godoc.org/github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/dsl#Matcher) argument that is then used to define and configure rules inside the group.

A rule definition always starts with [`Match(patterns...)`](https://godoc.org/github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/dsl#Matcher.Match) method call and ends with [`Report(message)`](https://godoc.org/github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/dsl#Matcher.Report) method call.

There can be additional calls in between these two. For example, a [`Where(cond)`](https://godoc.org/github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/dsl#Matcher.Where) call applies constraints to a match to decide whether its accepted or rejected. So even if there is a match for a pattern, it won't produce a report message unless it satisfies a `Where()` condition.
